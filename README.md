# Bubble Click Game 🎮

## About The Project 📖

The Bubble Click Game is an interactive web game designed to demonstrate the concept of event bubbling in JavaScript. Players click on floating bubbles, each with a unique number, to increase their score. It's a delightful and engaging way to learn about event handling in the DOM.

## How It Works 🛠️

- **Event Bubbling**: This game is built around the event bubbling principle, where an event triggered on a DOM element 'bubbles up' to its parents unless explicitly stopped.
- **Score Increment**: Each bubble has a number, and clicking on it increases the player's score by that number.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Bubbles are created and destroyed dynamically, showcasing DOM manipulation in real-time.

## Learning Outcomes 🎓

- **JavaScript Events**: Gained a deeper understanding of event handling and propagation in JavaScript.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Enhanced skills in dynamically creating and removing elements in the DOM.
- **Game Logic**: Developed logic for scoring and interactive gameplay.

## Features 🌟

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click as many bubbles as you can to increase your score!
- **Real-Time Updates**: The score updates instantly with each click, providing immediate feedback.
- **Stylish Design**: Aesthetically pleasing interface with colorful bubbles and smooth animations.

## Future Enhancements 🔮

- **Leaderboard**: Implement a global leaderboard to compare scores with other players.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Introduce difficulty settings that affect bubble speed and size.
- **Power-Ups**: Add special bubbles that trigger various effects, like score multipliers or extra time.
